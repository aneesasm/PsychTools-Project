Understand and specify context of use

  A. Current State/Baseline:
  
    1. There is no systematic means of tracking VA psychotherapy services or Veteran clinical responses
  
    2. Understanding, documenting, and continually improving the quality of VA psychotherapy services depends on routine collection of minimally necessary information to link: 
      • The Veteran’s mental health conditions and problems that are the focus of psychotherapy sessions
      • The psychotherapy services provided
      • Veteran reported outcomes 
    3. Collecting this essential information provides the basis for a robust quality management system for quality assurance and quality improvement
    4. Outcome feedback improves treatment outcomes 
       •A meta-analysis of 6 major trials estimated that patients who were classified as ‘not on track’ during treatment were 2.3 times more likely to deteriorate in usual therapy, by comparison to therapy + Outcome Feedback 
      • In published controlled trials, effect sizes favoring Outcome Feedback range between d = 0.2 and d = 0.9 
      • Importantly, Outcome Feedback helps to prevent deterioration

  B. Project Goal:
  
     1. Develop Decision support tools to inform clinical judgement and improve Veteran outcomes 
     2. Identification of Veterans who are at increased risk for drop out, limited clinical benefit, or deterioration 
     3. Generation of practice-based evidence
