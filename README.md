Understand and specify context of use

  A. Current State/Baseline:
    1. There is no systematic means of tracking VA psychotherapy services or Veteran clinical responses
    2. Understanding, documenting, and continually improving the quality of VA psychotherapy services           depends on routine collection of minimally necessary information to link: 
      • The Veteran’s mental health conditions and problems that are the focus of psychotherapy                 sessions
      • The psychotherapy services provided
      • Veteran reported outcomes 
    3. Collecting this essential information provides the basis for a robust quality management system        for quality assurance and quality improvement
